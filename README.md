# Leaflet Heat + Smooth Drag + Level of Detail

  

  

This is a demonstration application showcasing a modified version of the Leaflet Heat library. The original library has been enhanced with additional features including smooth drag operations and level of detail (LOD) rendering. These modifications were specifically implemented to handle large datasets more efficiently through various performance optimizations such as a quadtree-based LOD system and canvas optimizations.

  

  

This project serves as a proof of concept for the enhanced Leaflet Heat library capabilities, demonstrating how the modified version can handle performance-critical scenarios better than the original implementation.

  

  

## Getting Started

  

  

### Installation

  

  

First, install the dependencies:

  

  

```bash
yarn  install
```

  

  

### Development Server

  

  

Then, run the development server:

  

  

```bash
yarn  dev
```

  

  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

  

## Performance Optimizations

  

  

### Level of Detail (LOD) Implementation

  

  

This project includes a modified version of the Leaflet heat layer that implements Level of Detail (LOD) for improved performance with large datasets. The main optimizations include:

  

  

#### Quadtree-based LOD System

  

  

- Uses different resolution quadtrees based on zoom levels:

  

  

- Ultra Low Resolution: zoom ≤ 5

  

  

- Low Resolution: 5 < zoom ≤ 8

  

  

- Mid Resolution: 8 < zoom ≤ 12

  

  

- Mid-High Resolution: 12 < zoom ≤ 14

  

  

- High Resolution: zoom > 14

  

  

#### Extended Rendering Area

  

  

- Renders heatmap data beyond the visible viewport

  

  

- Provides smoother user experience when panning the map

  

  

- Reduces visual artifacts during map navigation

  

  

#### Canvas Optimizations

  

  

- Uses `willReadFrequently: true` flag for better canvas performance

  

  

- Implements efficient pixel manipulation strategies

  

  

- Optimizes memory usage during rendering

  

  

#### Spatial Query Improvements

  

  

- Utilizes quadtree spatial indexing for faster point queries

  

  

- Only processes points within the current map bounds

  

  

- Implements early return for out-of-view regions

  

  

### Development Notes

  

  

#### Modifying the Heatmap Source

  

  

If you need to modify the heatmap functionality, follow these steps:

  

  

1. Make your changes in `src/lib/heatmap-source/heatmap-source.js`

  

  

2. Run the minification command:

  

  

```bash
yarn  minify-heatmap
```

  

  

3. This will create/update `leaflet-heat.js` which is the actual library used by the application

  

  

The minification step is crucial as it:

  

  

- Optimizes the code for production

  

  

- Reduces file size

  

  

- Ensures compatibility across browsers

  

  

- Creates the final version used by the application

  

  

These optimizations significantly improve performance when dealing with large datasets while maintaining visual quality appropriate for each zoom level.

  

### Customization Options

  

The library supports extensive customization of the LOD (Level of Detail) system and heatmap appearance. Users can modify:

  

- LOD zoom level breakpoints

- Intensity levels for each LOD

- Quadtree cell sizes

- Visual parameters (radius, blur, gradient, opacity)

  

Please refer to the library documentation for detailed configuration options.

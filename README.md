This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Performance Optimizations

### Level of Detail (LOD) Implementation

This project includes a modified version of the Leaflet heat layer that implements Level of Detail (LOD) for improved performance with large datasets. The main optimizations include:

#### Quadtree-based LOD System
- Uses different resolution quadtrees based on zoom levels:
  - Ultra Low Resolution: zoom ≤ 5
  - Low Resolution: 5 < zoom ≤ 8
  - Mid Resolution: 8 < zoom ≤ 12
  - Mid-High Resolution: 12 < zoom ≤ 14
  - High Resolution: zoom > 14

#### Extended Rendering Area
- Renders heatmap data beyond the visible viewport
- Provides smoother user experience when panning the map
- Reduces visual artifacts during map navigation

These optimizations significantly improve performance when dealing with large datasets while maintaining visual quality appropriate for each zoom level.
